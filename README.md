# Self Assessment
The Battleships Python project features a fully functional game with player vs. AI capabilities. The game includes a grid-based board, ship placement, player turns, and AI logic for strategic gameplay. The code is modular, adhering to best practices, with a well-organized structure. Error handling ensures a smooth user experience. I did have issues in the beginning trying to run the `main.py` file but i got it sorted and I'm glad to say it works.
